# About
This is an attempt at creating a  deep reinforcement learning AI for the board game Connect Four.

## Model
The model is still in active development and testing. The idea is it should be able to teach itself to play by playing itself with minimal feature engineering if only using the board state proves to be impractical.

## Training
 
 Training is done in AI vs AI mode:
 ```python c4.py ava```
 
 You can play the AI in Human vs AI mode:
 ```python c4.py hva```
