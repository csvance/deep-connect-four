# About
This is an attempt at creating a  deep reinforcement learning AI for the board game Connect Four.

## Model
The model is still in active development and testing. However, the model will only take the state of the board as an input. The idea is it should be able to teach itself to play by playing itself.

## Training
 
 Training is done in AI vs AI mode:
 ```python connect_four.py ava --epsilon=1.```
 
 You can play the AI in Human vs AI mode:
 ```python connect_four.py hva```
